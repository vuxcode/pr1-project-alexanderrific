# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Summary

A description of how you want to present the project to the world
I want to present it like another way of taking score when playing yatzy.

A reflection of the experiences you had while creating the project
The thinking itself was my critical part, and I think it showes in my code.
I might be able to read it but it's messy and probably hard for others to read when compared to others, that is something for me to improve.

A list of what could be improved in the program if you had more time?
I've struggled with the function "winner()" that I want to run automaticly after all the variables are >= 0. I've tried with making a function that runs with every input;
"function checkWinner (If ettor1 >= 0 && ettorz >= 0){
winner()" but then I get the winner alert everytime I enter a score.
That's something i would've wanted and will add and continue to work with outside of school.

The code could've been cleaner. As we discussed there is an easier way to write this.

A conclusion on the budget. Did you manage to stick to the budget? Why? / Why not?
I'm fairly close to the budget. I think that if I've taken more time of work to be able to really focus on every lesson, I wouldn't have had to spend so much time researching previous lessons.

I would love for the program to be responsive. If you open it on your mobile phones browser it's not really enjoyable to play.

# User Guide

This is an app for taking score of a yatzy-game. Not the game itself. You will need your own physical dice.

Click the button which says the thing you want to register, i.e. not the box that says "Your result"

When asked if you got Yatzy, Liten stege etc: OK = YES
Avbryt/Cance = NO

Use your own dices.
