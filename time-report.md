   - Fixed the function so it loops if given the wrong answer.
   - Learned and implemented how to get the result from the input as text next to the button.

- Fixed the buttons 2-6
- Struggled with forcing the right input (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 for the threes for example). The answer was an array.
- The input-variables is inside of the functions, added them outside of the functions so that the program can fetch data from it.
