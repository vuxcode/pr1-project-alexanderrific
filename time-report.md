   - Got the heading centered and researched HTML.
   - Played with buttons and functions.

   - Function for what happens when you're pressing the number 1 button.

2024-03-25 12.15 1,5hr
   - Fixed the function so it loops if given the wrong answer.
   - Learned and implemented how to get the result from the input as text next to the button.

2024-03-27   10.30 1,5hr
- Fixed the buttons 2-6
- Struggled with forcing the right input (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 for the threes for example). The answer was an array.
- The input-variables is inside of the functions, added them outside of the functions so that the program can fetch data from it.

- Added the button for two pairs. And the function. In this function I wanted several conditions to be met, it should be dividable with 2, not greater than 22 etc. Googled my way to the syntax && .
- Stuck in two pairs if you misclicked and want to cancel that prompt.

- Solved the issue with two pairs.
- Added the rest of the buttons and created the variables for them.

2024-04-03 19.00   45min
- Wrote the function for yatzy.
- Tried to sum all values. Came to the conclusion that some are not defined as numbers. I think it will fix itself when I'm cleaning the code but added it to my to do list in case of.
Total time: 6h 50min.
